I am currently pursuing a BSc in Physics with Theoretical Physics at King's College London, expecting to graduate in May 2025. I have developed strong technical skills in Python, JavaScript, C++ and frameworks such as React and TensorFlow. My professional experience includes a Summer Internship at MS Amlin, where I conducted research on global risks and contribution to business strategy. I have also worked as a mathematics tutor and completed machine learning projects, including credit card fraud detection and apartment price prediction. Additionally, I organize youth events at a local mosque, combining my technical and leadership abilities across different fields.

## Objective
My journey in physics and technology has led me to develop a deep passion for machine learning, and I am now eager to transition into this field, especially aiming to join a team as a 
Machine Learning Engineer. Through hands-on experince with projects like fraud detection and predictive analytics, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis, model development, and programming with tools such as Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting, contributing to cutting-edge solutions while continuing to grow my expertise in AL and Machine Learning
